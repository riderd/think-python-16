Note I started with time.py but when I did import of that I had problems due to conflict with built-in time
different versions of add_time

note in my increment() method, I did this and got a failure which was seen with a simple unit test:
    seconds_time.seconds = seconds

pure functions

Can I set up some things in set up for constant time

prototyping vs planning & refactoring

mess with PYTHONPATH if you want to move test scripts into a test directory

What are the things to assert (Equal, NotEqual, ...)?

Write an assertion raised error

Deal with this comment:
        # way is to probably make another method that gets the day of the week from a date
        # and that can be tested well with different dates and then the current_day() method
        # is really simple and could be tested 
Write a unit test during class for this
