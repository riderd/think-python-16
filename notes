Note I started with time.py but when I did import of that I had problems due to conflict with built-in time
different versions of add_time

note in my increment() method, I did this and got a failure which was seen with a simple unit test:
    seconds_time.seconds = seconds

pure functions

Can I set up some things in set up for constant time
